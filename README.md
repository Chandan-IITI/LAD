Methods
--------
- implementation of (dual) one-class support vector machine
- implementation of (primal) structured output support vector machine
- implementation of (primal) non-convex latent one-class svm

Joint Feature Maps
-------------------
- multi-class joint feature map
- hidden Markov joint feature map
- basic procaryotic gene finding joint feature map (based on HMM-jfm) 

Examples
--------
- icml submission examples (some of them require special data)
